"""The PP-OCR engine: PaddleOCR's PP-OCRv6 text recognition models on
onnxruntime, next to Tesseract (tesseract.py).

A box already is a line of text, so only the recognition model runs (no text
detection). The models are PaddlePaddle's ONNX exports, downloaded by
scripts/fetch_models.py into ocr_models/ppocr/ (bundled by scoresight.spec).
The choices (stored as ocr_model, see ocr_models.py):

  ppocr:auto   "PP-OCR (automatic)", the default for new setups: accurate
               while it keeps up with Detections / s, fast when it can't
               (AutoChooser)
  ppocr:small  PP-OCRv6_small_rec, "PP-OCR (accurate)": 5.2M parameters, 21 MB
  ppocr:tiny   PP-OCRv6_tiny_rec, "PP-OCR (fast)": 1.1M parameters, 4.5 MB

The preprocessing and decoding are the OCR evaluation's (ocr_eval/engines/
ppocr.py), which match RapidOCR's:
- the box's colour crop (BGR, as the capture thread has it after rotation,
  crop, stabilization and four-corner correction, never binarized: the
  evaluation measured that ScoreSight's binarization costs these models 28-44
  points and gray about 1) is resized to the model's height (48 px) keeping its
  aspect ratio, scaled to [-1, 1] and padded with zeros on the right to at
  least the model's minimum width (320 px);
- greedy CTC decoding (PaddleOCR's CTCLabelDecode: the classes are the blank,
  characters.txt and a space), limited to the box's characters (its field
  type's whitelist, defaults.CHAR_WHITELISTS): at every time step the blank
  competes only with the allowed characters, and characters that are the same
  under NFKC (e.g. full-width digits) count as one. The confidence (0-1) is the
  mean probability of the characters kept; the evaluation found it well
  calibrated (at 0.9, about 1% of the crops were published wrong).

All of a frame's boxes are read together (Recognizer.recognize): one
session.run per distinct padded width, so a crop's reading never depends on the
other boxes in the frame. Every box up to 6.67:1 (320/48) has the same padded
width, so a frame usually takes a single run.

onnxruntime is imported, and the model loaded, on a background thread when the
model is first selected (start_loading): the import takes about 66 ms and
creating the small model's session 60 ms, which would otherwise hold up the
window or the capture thread. Until it is ready, TextDetector returns no
reading (Empty) for the boxes; if it fails, TextDetector falls back to
Tesseract and says so. Recognizers are shared (get_recognizer): onnxruntime's
sessions can run on several threads at once.

The cost: on a fast desktop CPU's performance core the small model takes about
17 ms per box on one thread, on one of its efficiency cores about 43 ms (10
boxes read 5 times a second: 87% and 213% of a core); tiny takes a fifth of
that. Laptop cores are more like the efficiency cores, hence PP-OCR
(automatic). The sessions use INTRA_OP_THREADS (2) onnxruntime threads that
sleep instead of spinning while idle: two threads make a read about 1.8 times
faster for about 5% more CPU time (spinning costs CPU and gains nothing here).
Set SCORESIGHT_PPOCR_THREADS to change it (0: onnxruntime's default, every
core).
