"""Auto crop and Auto layout: the scoreboard and its fields, found by an AI
model on the picture.

The model (D-FINE-S, Apache-2.0) finds six kinds of boxes on a picture: the
home score, the away score, the clock, the period, other fields and the
scoreboard itself. It is ScoreSight's own, published on Hugging Face
(MODEL_REPO, with its evaluation), and it isn't bundled: it is downloaded the
first time it is used, at a pinned revision, checked against its pinned
SHA-256, into models_dir(). The pictures never leave the computer.

This module doesn't touch the UI: the main window (auto_layout_ui) runs it on a worker
thread and turns its results into the crop and the fields' boxes.
